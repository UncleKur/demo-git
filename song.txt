End of passion play, crumbling away
(I'm your source of self-destruction)

Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
(Leading on your deaths' construction)


Taste me you will see
More is all you need

Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Obey your master
(Master)

Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
